I really enjoyed this course! I had quite a bit of engaging content that opened my eyes to the world of actuarial studies. The lectures were well-structured and the concepts were explained clearly (thanks Xiao Xu and Peter Lee!). I appreciated the practical examples and real-world applications incorporated into the lessons, which helped solidify my understanding. The assignments and projects were challenging yet rewarding, providing a great opportunity to apply what we learned. The instructors were supportive and always available to help with any questions. Overall, I feel more confident in my foundational knowledge of actuarial studies and am excited to delve deeper into this field. Highly recommend this course to anyone interested in actuarial science!
